# The-Data-Visualization
 👉 This is a Math project I worked on in my Highschool 🏫
 👉 I used Javascript to create a interactive Data visualization on p5 based on the data I collected about student's GPA and Attendance.
 👉 My goal was to display how a student's attendance affects their GPA in school.
